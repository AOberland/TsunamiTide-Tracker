First stab at this, accidentally deleted cursor agent (ha) but uploading from local copy?

Manually loading seems too many files to just drop the whole folder in so zipped it.

I'm sure i could make it sync up with git locally or even cursor but meh, diffeent test.

Ryan, I NEED BEST PRACTICES!!!! Plz â™¥
